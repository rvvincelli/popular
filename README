This is a C implementation of the audio fingerprinting technique 
described in http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1835554, "Robust Audio 
Identification for MP3 Popular Music"
and reviewed in http://www.scribd.com/doc/145082400/Fingerprint-and-quality-based-audio-track-retrieval.

There are two separate Eclipse CDT projects, popularFW and popularBW, for the forward/fingerprinting and 
backward/matching algorithms. The former is based on the popular musicout.c source. Overall project configuration is not
100% accurate, but in order to import them correctly, copy the directories to your workspace and create two new projects
with the same names; uncheck the Debug configuration box. The compilation toolkit the makefile was automatically 
generated for by Eclipse is Cygwin GCC, but units are supposed to compile on any unix flavor with little or no 
modification. Binaries are included.

popularFW\script contains some .bat executables to be used as External tools; I automatized the whole testing 
procedure with these scripts. Check them to try the algorithm and read 
the second document to better understand the whole picture.
